# Why NHibernate?

* Removes business logic from the DB.  Logic belongs in the code.
* Removes SQL from the app.  SQL can be generated by the DAL.
* Increases code reusability and readability.
* Stop writing SQL in our code and stop using stored procs.
* Leave DB optimizations in the db (via views, etc)
