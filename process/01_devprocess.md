* Write code
* Manually check everything and commit
* Send code to QA

# Ideally What We Do Now #
* Get requirements

* Write better code with less effort
* Pass unit tests <span style="color: #00FF00;">(GREEN)</span>
* Refactor code <span style="color: #0000FF;">(REFACTOR)</span>
* Manually check everything and commit
* Send code to QA

# Keys To This Process #
* Writing better, cleaner, more readable and maintainable code 
* Using the best tools available to us to get code written faster
* Combining that code in a smart manner to create a better application
* Writing unit tests to verify each individual part meets our standards
